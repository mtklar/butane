# butane

This repository comprises code that simulates the dynamics of a butane molecule as described in [^1] first for the [original system](/original_system.nb) and second for the [homogenised system](/homogenised_system.nb). To combine the two animations into one, as presented below, use [this](/create_animation.nb).

Note: The initial conditions are the same in both systems, but the respective dynamics diverge considerably over time.
